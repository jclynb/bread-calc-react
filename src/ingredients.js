//But the high hydration of quick breads doesnâ€™t affect their structure because eggs provide most of their structure, not gluten.
//Before we leave the topic of fat and hydration: Eggs are a special case.  
//Because the yolk has fat and the white has protein, you need to be careful just adding it to a dough that isn't enriched with anything else.  
//While the egg yolk adds softness to a dough, whites add protein strands which increase the chewiness of the loaf.  
//Too much protein and the loaf will be too tough.  For this reason, Peter Reinhart adds milk and oil, butter or bacon grease in addition to the egg.  
//Another adaptation I've seen has you add one egg plus an additional egg yolk to increase the fat.  It's up to you which you prefer.
